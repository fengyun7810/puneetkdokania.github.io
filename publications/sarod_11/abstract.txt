This paper presents work on navigation of a UAV by using Extended Kalman Filter based GPS / INS integration. A
mathematical model has been developed and simulated for the same. A cruise trajectory at a fixed angle of attack is taken as the
flight path of the UAV along with the assumption of ideal control. The UAV navigation is done using the Inertial Navigation System
(INS) but the errors due to the INS measurements grow with time, which need to be checked. Thus GPS is used as another aid of
measurement and is integrated with INS using Extended Kalman Filter to correct the INS state estimates. Also, the errors in
accelerometer and gyroscope are estimated and are used to correct the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements to achieve a
higher accuracy in navigation.
