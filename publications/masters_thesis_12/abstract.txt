Predicting driver's behaviors is a key component for future Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this thesis, a novel approach based on Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian filter (BF) is proposed for online lane change
intention prediction. The approach uses the multiclass probabilistic outputs of the
Support Vector Machine as an input to the Bayesian filter, and the posterior output
of the Bayesian filter is used for the final prediction of lane changes. A particle
filter based lane tracker integrated with a Lexus experimental platform is used for
real-world data acquisition for the purpose of training and testing. Data from dif-
ferent drivers on different highways were used for the robustness evaluation of the
overall approach. In-depth analysis of the proposed approach is also done and pre-
sented. The proposed approach is able to predict driver's intention to change lane
1.3 seconds (average) earlier with maximum prediction horizon of 3.29 seconds.
