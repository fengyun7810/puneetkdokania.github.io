Abstractâ€” Predicting driver behavior is a key component for
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this paper, a
novel approach based on Support Vector Machine and Bayesian
filtering is proposed for online lane change intention prediction.
The approach uses the multiclass probabilistic outputs of the
Support Vector Machine as an input to the Bayesian filter,
and the posterior output of the Bayesian filter is used for the
final prediction of lane changes. A lane tracker integrated in a
passenger vehicle is used for real-world data acquisition for the
purpose of training and testing. Data from different drivers on
different highways were used for the robustness evaluation of
the overall approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed
approach is able to predict driver intention to change lanes on
average 1.3 seconds in advance, with a maximum prediction
horizon of 3.29 seconds.
