A new approach for edge detection using a combination of bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) and prob-
abilistic derivative technique derived from Ant Colony Systems, is presented in this paper. The foraging
behavior of some species of bacteria like Escherichia coli can be hypothetically modeled as an optimiza-
tion process. A group of bacteria search for nutrients in a way that maximizes the energy obtained per
unit time spent during the foraging. The proposed approach aims at driving the bacteria through the edge
pixels. The direction of movement of the bacteria is found using a direction probability matrix, computed
using derivatives along the possible directions. Rules defining the derivatives are devised to ensure that
the variation of intensity due to noise is discarded. Quantitative analysis of the feasibility of the proposed
approach and its comparison with other standard edge detection operators in terms of kappa and entropy
are given. The effect of initial values of parameters of BFA on the edge detection is discussed.
